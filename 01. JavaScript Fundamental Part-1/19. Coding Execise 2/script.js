Coding Challenge #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Hint: Use an if/else statement ï¿½

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

if(BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
    console.log("Mark's BMI is higher than John's!");
} else {
    console.log("John's BMI is higher than Mark's!");
}

if(BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI ${BMIMark} is higher than John's ${BMIJohn}!`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI ${BMIJohn} is higher than Mark's ${BMIMark}!`);
}

/* Output:

Mark's BMI is higher than John's!
Mark's BMI 27.309968138370508 is higher than John's 24.194608809993426!
